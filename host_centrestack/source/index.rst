Introduction
==============

Welcome to the Hosted-|prodname| Administration Guide. This guide describes
administration tasks for |prodname| (Hosted Version), the managed file synchronization
and sharing solution. 

|prodname| Server can be self-hosted, or already hosted
by |websiteurl|. This guide is
for the Hosted-|prodname|.

When |prodname| is already hosted, a lot of the |prodname| side of the setup and administration
work are not necessary anymore. Administrators 
can focus on their customers and help their customers.
