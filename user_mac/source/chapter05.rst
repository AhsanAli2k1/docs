There are many settings in this panel. Here are some specifically for the Mac Client.

**Start Mac client automatically** - When this option is checked the user will be automatically authenticated to the cloud volume upon system restarts.

**Do not show Mac Client sync status pop up dialog** - There will be times when users do not want to see the sync progress windows which can be suppressed by selecting this opt ion.
