Primary Use Cases
===================

1. Collaborative access to the Cloud Drive

The Drive based random access is one of the primary way of accessing files and folders in the cloud drive.

2. Syncing local folders to the Cloud Drive for remote access

Another primary use case is users want to continue to work in a local folder, and then attach that folder to the |prodname| account so the content of the folder (or folders) will be synchronized in a 2-way fashion between the local Mac folder and the remote |prodname| folder.

After the installation is completed, a system tray icon will appear that allows you to open your |prodname| Drive.
