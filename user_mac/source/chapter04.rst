4 Folder and File Features
****************************

When you Right click on a folder or a file you can access the context menu, which allows you to Share, Get share link, enable offline Access, Open in web browser, and Force Refresh.

Folder and File Sharing
=========================

To share a file or folder, simply right click on it and select **"Share"** from the menu item:

A wizard will be launched to allow you to "Invite People". To set this up, click the **Share Icon (1)**. In the new window enter the email(s) **(2)** of anyone you wish to share this with seperated by semicolons (;). Click **"CONTINUE" (3)**.

In the next window you can choose how you want to share: expiration time, access rights (read only, view only, full control). After making your option selections, choose **"SHARE" (4)** or **"GET LINK" (5)**. "SHARE" sends emails to your guest users and "GET LINK" opens a window with the URL you can use to create a custom email or use some other method to communicate with your guest users.
